# Description

This project contains a modified version of `camunda-engine` that is more Clojure friendly.
- `lib/camunda-engine-7.15.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` based on the following commit: https://github.com/arnaudgeiser/camunda-bpm-platform/commit/3e0c618b9fc1cbcb59e971753e97297f07b5b2d9
- `resources/simple-diagram.bpmn` contains a new XML attribute called `clojure`
- `src/clj-camunda/core.clj` contains the integration and examples in `comment`

This is my answer to Tim ZÃ¶ller about his talk __Workflow engines with Clojure, it's a match__.  
During his presentation, he draw a clear picture about the experience we currently have when
working with Camunda from Clojure. It's accurate, straightforward and the exploration he did
is beneficial for the community.
Here I propose to look at the situation from another angle: 

__What is the experience we want to have when working with Camunda from Clojure?__

Let's start with Tim's conclusion:

I agree on most of them, with different thumb directions. 

# Readable Delegates

I confess, delegate is more readable in Clojure than Java, but
not by a large margin. Having to generate a class for every `service task`
is impractical. But he knows it pretty well:

> We need to implement the same Java interface. This is not ideal, I know that.
> And this also lead to us... needing to precompile this class to work with the REPL

![](images/delegate.png)

Having to work with Java Interop is not that uncomfortable. What bother me the most
is the number of lines I have to write for every square in my BPMN diagram (and the fact
that every class needs to be precompiled).

### Going further

Taking an even simpler diagram with 3 service tasks and one gateway, I would expect
to write the following either through __Java Interop__ or through a __Clojure macro__:

![](images/simple-diagram.png)


__Through Java Interop__

``` clojure
(defn send-mail [e]
  (let [email (get (.getVariables e) "email")]
    (prn "I'm sending an email to : " email)
    (re-find #"gmail" email)))

(defn log-other-email-account [_]
  (prn "Log other email account"))

(defn log-gmail-account [_]
  (prn "Log gmail account"))
```

__Through Clojure macro__

By having a `defprocess` macro we would be able to provide an idiomatic feeling when 
working with Camunda

``` clojure
(defmacro defprocess
  "Defines a Camunda process"
  [& clauses]
  (cons 'do
    (for [clause clauses
          :let [[n p f] clause]]
      `(defn ~n ~'[e]
          ~(if (seq p)
            `(let [~@p (execution-entity->map ~'e)] ~f)
            f)))))

(defprocess
  (send-mail [{{:keys [email]} :variables}]
    (prn (str "I'm sending an email to " email))
    (re-find #"gmail" email))
  (log-other-email-account [] (prn "Log other email account"))
  (log-gmail-account [] (prn "Log gmail account")))
```

### What needs to be done

This experience won't be available out of the box without a small contribution
in Camunda. It would be great if Camunda was able to call Clojure code.
It can be done with some minor modifications:

# Engine Integration

Java Interop is not really fun, but by providing a Clojure wrapper around Camunda, it 
shouldn't be a big deal.

# Task Orchestration

As mentioned, Task Orchestration is pretty neat already. Having a keyword based API
would be more convenient

# Unified Language

![](images/gateway.png)

In theory, Camunda should be able to support a large variety of languages. Every
JSR-233 ScriptEngine should be usable. In practice, it's not the case.
Clojure should be considered a dynamic language, but based on the following code, it was
not true:

```java
public static boolean isDynamicScriptExpression(String language, String value) {
    return StringUtil.isExpression(value) &&
                !JuelScriptEngineFactory.names.contains(language.toLowerCase());
}
```

Only languages using `${}` are considered dynamic:

```java
public static boolean isExpression(String text) {
    text = text.trim();
    return text.startsWith("${") || text.startsWith("#{");
}
```

### What needs to be done
A better support for dynamic scripting engine is necessary.
A dirty hack:

# Follow-ups
- Support `clojure` or `clojure-var` attribute in Camunda Engine (https://github.com/arnaudgeiser/camunda-bpm-platform/commit/3e0c618b9fc1cbcb59e971753e97297f07b5b2d9
)
- Support `clojure` or `clojure-var` attribute in Camunda Modeler
- Better ScriptEngine support in Camunda
- Clojure wrapper around Camunda for better experience
- Some processes are simple and could be express directly from EDN files
